# Decision-Trees-ML

This Decision-Tree-ML repo implements a ID3 decision tree algorithm that was trained using the data from `training.csv`. 

## To run the program:

Install dependencies:
`pip install math`
`pip install pickle`
`pip install numpy`

Run:
`python main.py`

### Some functions:

Gini_index 

Entropy

Missclassification_error

Impure - calls gini-index or entropy or missclassification-error

Information_gain - call Impure method

chi-square - performs a chi-square test
